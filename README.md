# Prework-study-guide-Webpage

A study guide for the course pre-work

# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

- My motivation is to improve my familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to create study notes to reference at a later date.
- I built this project because I needed an interactive way to make notes while learing coding languages. Creating practical examples that i can reference later seems to be an effective way to make notes while learning how to code.
- This project solves the problem of having to remember everything I read, the limitations of pen and paper, and the limitation of taking notes using google docs, word, or pages to take notes. Finally it provides an interactive study guide that allows for opportunities to interact with code while studying code.
- I learned the basic overview of the functionality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to use Git, VS code, & webpage dev tools

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage is meant to be used as a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript study guide. There are lots of examples that to fully unstand how they work the code needs to be examined via the inspect feature of a web browser. To properly use the study guide inspect the elements and console to see the code at work.

For example CSS styling has been added to some text via internal style sheets. By looking at the code you can see the internal style sheet at work in the head section of the HTML doc.

To fully use the study guide make sure to check out all elements of it as scene in the screenshot
