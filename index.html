          <li>Parent and child framework is used to describe nested elements</li>
          <li>
            Semantic elements are better for SEO, accessibility and readability
            than basic 'div'

          <li>
            semantics are very important when writing code because they create
            order
          </li>
        
          <li>
            Attributes are added in the opening tag and are critical for
            elements like images
          </li>
          <li>
            an image alt ="" is an accessibility feature that displays text when
            the image is not loaded or is accesses by accessibility software
          </li>
          <li>there are laws requiring accessability</li>
          <li>image src ="" is how the image source is linked into the code</li>
          <li>
            some elements don't need a closing tag, for example images does not need
            a closing tag
          </li>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element
          </li>
          <li>
            class="card" has class attributes applied to it by the class
            selector . 
          </li>
          <li>
              a is the tag used for anchors, these are used to embed hyperlinks in the text. href attribute is used to add the link in the opening tag

            <a

              This is link about anchors
            </a>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>target attribute specifies how a link should open.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                value of "_blank" will open link in new window, with modern
                browsers it opens a link in a new tab
              </li>
              
            </ul>
            <li>./ tells the browser to look in the same folder</li>
            <li>../ says go back one folder then look</li>
            <li>
              <a href="./hyperlink.html" target="_blank">Example Hyperlink</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              anchors can be text or images. As long as the image or text is
              wrapped by and anchor element it will behave as an anchor
            </li>
            <li>
              Anchors can be used to direct users to different parts of the
              site.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Whitespace and indentation makes code easier to read</li>
          <li>comments are made by using !-- followed by -- tags, this can be a useful technique to deactivate code with out deleting it</li>
          <li>Two very common Global attributes class and id</li>
          <li>When using headings</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not skip ex. from h1 to h3</li>
            <li>
              Do not use headers to resize font. Instead use CSS font-size
            </li>
            <li>Only one h1 per page</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Tables
            <ul>
              <li>The table element creates a table.</li>
              <li>The tr element adds rows to a table.</li>
              <li>To add data to a row, you can use the td element.</li>
              <li>
                Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added
                with the th element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Table data can span columns using the colspan="" attribute.
              </li>
              <li>Table data can span rows using the rowspan="" attribute.</li>
              <li>
                Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body,
                and a footer.
              </li>
              <li>A tables head is created with the thead element.</li>
              <li>A tables body is created with the tbody element.</li>
              <li>A tables footer is created with the tfoot element.</li>
              <li>
                All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be
                applied to tables and their data.

          <li>Type</li>
          <ul>
            <li>type selector matches the type of element in the HTML</li>
            <li>ex. p element, line element</li>
            <li>universal selector * selects elements of anytype</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Class</li>
          <ul>
            <li> When working with HTML and CSS a class attribute is one of the most common ways to select an element</li>
            <li> dont for get the . when using class selectors</li>
            <li class="bold green">Elements can have multiple classes like me. I was made bold and green with multiple classes and internal stylesheet</li>
            <li id="style1">I am styled with id selector using an internal stylesheet, </li>
            <li>class uses # in the .css and id uses . before the selector when creating a ruleset. just look in the html for this web page</li>
            <li>elements can only have one id attribute and the id element can only be used once per page</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Attribute</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Attribute selectors allow us to select based off which attributes are present and the contents of the attribute. We can be as broad as we like and select all href attributes or be more specific and only select href with a specific string in the value</li>
              <li>This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes"> link </a>to a list of attributes is light blue because a attribute selector made it that way. Notice the brackets in the code and seemingly arbitrary inclusion of the element. I think the including the element increases specificity.</a></li>

          <li>Pseudo-class</li>
            <ul>
              <li>allows the apperance of elements to change after interaction</li>
              <li>ex. when you click a blue link on a page and it turns purple</li>
              <li>Ex of psuedo classes = :focus, :visited, :disabled, :active</li>
              <li>can be added to any selector. Ex. <a href="./assets/bowtie-cat.png" target="_blank" id="hover">p:hover</a></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Using a assigning and id and using a psuedo class selector to enable hover feature on the above link</li>

            </ul>
          <li>Specificity</li>
            <ul>
              <li>CSS can select HTML elements by their type, class, and ID</li> 
              <li>Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed. Best practice is to go from least specific to most specific</li>
              <li>ID is most specific, then classes and finaly type</li>
              <li>To make styles easy to edit, its best to style with a type selector, if possible. If not, add a class selector. If that is not specific enough, then consider using an ID selector.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Chaining</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If an html element has two or more CSS selectors at the same time they are combined into a chain.</li> 
              <li>Ex. h1.special - would be the selector for the special class of h1</li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Descendant Combinator</li>

                  <li>decendents are nested elements in other html elements</li>
                  <li>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>chaining increases specificity</li>
              <li>More specific css selectors overrule more general selectors</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Multiple Selectors</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In order to make CSS more concise, it’s possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors all at once. This prevents writing repetitive code.</li>

            <li>Ruleset terms</li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Selector</em> - the beginning of the ruleset used to target the element that will be styled</li>
              <li><em>Declaration Block</em> - The code in-between (and including) the curley braces that conatins the CSS declaration(s)</li>
              <li><em>Declaration </em> - The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element.</li>
              <li><em>Property</em> - The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic of the element is to be modified</li>
              <li><em>Value</em> - The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline Style terms</li>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Opening Tag</em> - The start of an HTML element. This is the element that will be styled</li>
                <li><em>Attribute</em> - The style attribute is used to add CSS inline styles to an HTML element/li>
                <li><em>Declaration</em> - The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element</li>
                <li><em>Property</em> - The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic of the element is to be modified</li>
                <li><em>Value</em> - The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <li style='color: red';> Inline styling made me red </li>
          <li class="inline">Internal stylesheets made me blue</li>
          <li> inline style sheets can also be used in the head of the html doc</li>
          <li>the perfered way to style is with external style sheet because it separates the CSS code separate from the html which keeps the code looking clean and free of repetition</li>
            <ul>
              <li>.css files must be linked</li>
              <li>link goes in the head section</li>
              <li>href is the attribute used similar to the anchor element</li>
              <li>rel - the is attribute describes the relationhsip between the html and teh css file. when linking  to a stylesheet the value is stylesheet</li>
            
            </ul>
          <li></li>
          <li>Add you notes about css here!</li>
          <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets</li>
          <li>
            Class selectors like .card are assigned CSS rules in the .css file
          </li>
          <li>the . in .card desig nates this as a class selector</li>
          <li>
            Element selectors target specific elements. <br />
            two other selectors are id and class
          </li>
          <li>box-sizing: border-box; vs old model = old model (content-box) actual rendered width was content box + margin + border + padding: new model border-box takes all that into account</li>
          <li>All HTML elements are boxes made up of four components: a content container, padding border, and margin</li>
          <li>CHEAT - when inspection an element with dev tools to see all boxes on the page add a css line of code that is applied to all, makes a boarder that is 1px, red, and add bang important !important</li>
          <li>box-sizing: border-box; - adjusts how the box is measured this is best practice right now to use.</li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li><strong>Display and Positioning</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Block-level elements create a box that blocks the full width of their parent elements and prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space</li>
            <li>position property changes default position of the element</li>
            <ul>
              <li>static - does not need to be set -  position is positioned normal relative to the flow of the page</li>
              <li>relative</li>
              <ul>
                <li>offest properties move the element relative to its static position. top, left, right, bottom</li>
              </ul>
              <li>absolute</li>
              <ul>
                <li>all other elements are ignored and the position is set relative to the closest positioned parent element.</li>
                <li>if no parent exists then it is position in top left corner or 0,0</li>
              </ul>
              <li>fixed</li>
              <ul> 
                <li>will not scroll says fixed</li>
                <li>offset properties can adjust the location of the element</li>
              </ul>
              <li>sticky</li>
              <ul>
                <li>keeps the element in the flow but keeps its position when the page scrolls</li>
              </ul>
              <li>z-index - how far back or forward the element is in relation to other elements.</li>
              <li>z-index does not work with static elements</li>
              <li>default z-index is zero, 1 is ontop of 0, 2 is ontop of 1 and so on</li>
            </ul>
            <li>display value dictates if it can share horizontal space with other elements</li>
            <ul>
              <li>inline display the box wraps tightly around just the content. heigth and width can not be specified.</li>
              <li>display property alows us to make any element and inline element</li>
              <li>block-level elements take up the entire width of the page but their width can be set. unless otherwise specified they are the height required to support their content</li>
              <li>some elements are block level by default a complete list is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content" target="_blank">here</a></li>
              <li>inline-block - combine features of both inline and block elements. they can occur next to each other and can have height and width properties specified. Imgages are examples of inline-block elements </li>
            <li>float property allows us to move an element as far right or left as possible in a container</li>
            <li>Floated elements must have a width specified otherwise they will be the entire width and the float will have no effect</li>
            <li>floated elements can bump into each other the CLEAR property specifes how elements should behave when they bump into each other</li>
            <ul>
              <li>left - using this clear property the element will move all the way to the left even if another elment is blocking it</li>
              <li>right - </li>
              <li>both - </li>
              <li>neither - </li>
              <li>? clear makes elements not treat floating elements like they are floating. from what i understand</li>
            </ul>
            <li>display and positioning codecademy</li>
            <ul>The position property allows you to specify the position of an element.<br>
              When set to relative, an element’s position is relative to its default position on the page.<br>
              When set to absolute, an element’s position is relative to its closest positioned parent element. It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.<br>
              When set to fixed, an element’s position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.<br>
              When set to sticky, an element can stick to a defined offset position when the user scrolls its parent container.<br>
              The z-index of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.<br>
              The display property allows you to control how an element flows vertically and horizontally in a document.<br>
              inline elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually adjusted width or height.<br>
              block elements take up the width of their container and can have manually adjusted heights.<br>
              inline-block elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.<br>
              The float property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.<br>
              You can clear an element’s left or right side (or both) using the clear property.</ul>

          </ul>
          <li>operator - character that performs a task in our code</li>
          <li>remainder operator (modulo) - returns the number that remains after the right hand number divides in to the left hand number as many times as it can evenly. So 11 % 3 equals 2.</li>
          <li>concatenation - the process of appending one string to another</li>
          <li>When ever data is entered into JavaScript it is saved as an instance and every instance has a set of properties assigned to it. One such property is .length Every string has this property. by appending the string with a period and property name you can retrieve the specific property</li>

            to connect script.js we need to add script src="./assets/script.js">

          <li>
            Comments are make using /* with the comment being writen in the
            middle of the these opening and closing tags */ <br />
            if the comment does not contain breaks it can be writen behind //
          </li>
          <li>
            scripts are called like links are for CSS, opening tag contains a src

          <li></li>
          <li>varriables are named containers that store data</li>
          <li>
            var declares a variable <br />
            var shape = "circle"
          </li>
          <li>
            after declaring a varriable you can give it a value. This can be
            done in the same line. <br> ^^ circle is the value for shape ^^
          </li>
          <li>
            scripts are writen at the bottom on the body of the html file
            because code reads from top to bottom and we want to make sure all
            the code is loaded befor running a script
          </li>
          <li>Strings are writen within in ""</li>
          <li>values can be numbers, strings, arrays, boolean and maybe more</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>JavaScript reads code from top to bottom</li>
          <li>Conditinoal statements and loops control the order in which coe is executed</li>
          <li>If statements are one way to create a conditional statement</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal. </li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow. Interrupting the control flow in this way allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>to access value in array array name and index need to be used. If just the name is used the entire array will be returned. Index number alows us to select individual data items in an array</li>
          <li>the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A loop contains three key elements</li>
          <ul>
            <li>first statement defines the starting point of the loop. x=0 starts at the first index in the array</li>
            <li>Second statement is teh condition. The loop will run till the condition is met. As long as the varriable is less than the length of the array it will run. shapes.length the .lenght is added to the end of the varriable to denote its length. .length is an array property</li>
            <li>Third tells the for loop what to do each time it completes a loop. This allows it to iterate each time it goes through a loop. in our example x++ is used so the value of x increases by one each time we go through the loop</li>
          </ul>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable.</li>
          <li>To call a function type the function name with the () into code. This will cause the function to be executed</li>
          <li>Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().<br>
            We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.<br>
            There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.<br>
            Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879<br>
            Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'<br>
            The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.<br>
            Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.<br>
            Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().<br>
            We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.<br>
            Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.</li>
            <li><strong>objects are data types. objects have properties which are denoted after a .</strong></li>
            <li><strong>. is used to call methods which perform actions</strong></li>
          <li>variables</li>
          <ul>
            <li>a variable is a container for a value</li>
            <li>variables are also wayes to label data with descriptive name</li>
            <li>variable only do three things</li>
            <ol class="variable">
              <li>create a variable with a descriptive name</li>
              <li>store or update information stored in a variable</li>
              <li>reference or get information stored ina variable</li>
            </ol>
            <li>camelCase - standard convention in JavaScript, words are grouped and the first is lower case and every other word has first letter uppercase. variable names are use camelCase</li>
            <li>variables can be reasigned let signifies this</li>
            <li>const variable cannot be reassigned</li>
            <li>declared const variables must have a value assigned to them</li>
            <li>when deciding which keyword to use consider if you will be reasigning the value later on. if you are then use const otherwise use let</li>

            <li>variable review</li>
            <li class="variableReview">Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.<br>
              Variables are stored in memory. <br>
              The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.<br>
              let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.<br>
              Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.<br>
              Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.<br>
              The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.<br>
              In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.<br>
              The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.</li>
