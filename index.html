          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Enter your HTML notes here</li>
            <li> The code has a general structure starting with !DOCTYPE, then an opening tag for the element for example html if its html, then the head, <br> by the body, with in the body is the header, main, and footer, the closing tags follow for each element</li>
            <li> The head contains information about the webpage such as metadata and the title of the page</li>
            <li> The body contains visible content on the page</li>
            <li> Parent and child framwork is used to describe nested elements</li>
            <li> Lists can be ordered, ol, or unordered ul; each line of the list uses the tage 'li'</li>
            <li> Semantic elements are better for SEO, accessibility and readability than basic 'div'</li>
            <li> The "p" tag can be used to create new paragraphs</li>
            <li> semantics are very important when writing code because they create order</li>
            <li> Some semantic tags are "Head" "body" with in body "header" "main" "footer"
            <li> some more semantic tags are ul, ol, li, br, </li>
            <li> Attributes are added in the opening tag and are critical for elements like images</li>
            <li> an image alt ="" is an accessibility feature that displays text when the image is not loaded or is accessesby by accessibility softwar</li>
            <li> image src ="" is how the image sorce is linked into the code</li>
            <li> some elements dont need a closing tag, for example images doent need a closing tag </li>
            <li> A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li> A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li> class="card" has class attributes applied to it by the class selector. Is this true?</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Add you notes about css here!</li>
          <li> CSS stands for cascading style sheets</li>
          <li> Class selectors like .card are assigned CSS rules in the .css file</li>
          <li> the . in .card desig nates this as a class selector </li>
          <li> Element selectors target specific elements. <br> two other selectors are id and class</li>

        <h2>javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          
          <li> to connect script.js we need to add script src="./assets/script.js"> /script right before the closing body tag</li>
          <li> Comments are make using /* with the comment being writen in the middle of the these opening and closing tags */ <br> if the comment does not contain breaks it can be writen behind //</li>
          <li> scripts are called like inks are for CSS, opening tag contains a src = ""</li>
          <li>Add notes for javascript here!</li>
          <li> varriables are named containers that store data</li>
          <li> var declares a variable <br> var shape = "circle" </li>
          <li> after declaring a varriable you can give it a value. This can be done in the same line</li>
          <li> scripts are writen at the bottom on the body of the html file because code reads from top to bottom and we want to make sure all the code is loaded befor running a script</li>
